# Online_Payment_Fraud_Detection

# Description:
Developed a comprehensive online payment fraud detection system utilizing Django, a high-level Python web framework, and implemented a decision tree classifier model for efficient fraud identification.

# Web Application Development:
Built a user-friendly web interface using Django, ensuring seamless navigation and responsiveness for users.

# Data Processing and Feature Engineering:
Processed and cleaned large datasets to extract relevant features for model training.
Conducted thorough feature engineering to enhance the model's ability to detect subtle patterns indicative of fraud.

# Machine Learning Model Implementation:
Implemented a decision tree classifier model using Python's scikit-learn library.
Fine-tuned the model parameters to achieve optimal performance in terms of accuracy and precision in fraud detection.

# Technologies Used:
Django
Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
SQLite

# Results:
The implemented online payment fraud detection system successfully reduced fraud instances by [insert percentage] through the integration of the decision tree classifier model, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and preventing fraudulent activities.
